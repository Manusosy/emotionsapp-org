# Comprehensive Group Management System Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive group management system for the Emotions App mood mentors dashboard with advanced member tracking, attendance analytics, and progressive meeting visualization.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Patients Page (`src/features/mood_mentors/pages/PatientsPage.tsx`)
- **Group Assignment**: Added ability to add patients to support groups directly from the patients list
- **Group Membership Display**: Visual badges showing which groups each patient belongs to

- **Group Availability Check**: Shows only groups that aren't full and patient isn't already in

#### New Features:
- "Add to Group" button for each patient
- Real-time group membership updates
- Visual group badges with remove functionality
- Smart dropdown showing available groups with member counts

### 2. Comprehensive Group Management Component (`src/features/mood_mentors/components/GroupManagement.tsx`)
A powerful new component providing complete group oversight with three main tabs:

- **Performance Categories**: 
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Active** (75%+ attendance)
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Moderate** (50-74% attendance) 
  - ðŸ”´ **At Risk** (<50% attendance)
- **Last Attendance**: Shows when member last attended a session

- âœ… Complete foreign key relationships with cascade deletes

#### **Sample Data Created**
- 4 active support groups with real mentor profiles
- Sample group members for testing
- Historical sessions for analytics
- Attendance records showing realistic participation patterns

## Summary

This implementation provides mood mentors with powerful tools to:
- **Track Member Engagement**: See who's participating and who needs support

The progressive meeting visualization specifically addresses your request to "track each member within the group easily" by showing the journey from Meeting 1 through Meeting 6 and beyond, with clear attendance trends that help mentors understand group dynamics and member commitment over time.
